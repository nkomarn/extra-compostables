# extra-compostables
A **simple**, absolutely **bare-bones**, and **performance-optimal** way to make more items compostable in a composter block! 

Written in just 60 lines of code, this plugin doesn't mess with any behavior and simply registers configured items into the composter block's internal compostables registry. Vanilla handles the rest!

Due to the nature of the implementation, this plugin is currently **only compatible with 1.17 servers**. If requested, I can add backwards compatibility for older versions.

Inspired by [Little Composter](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/little-composter.73880/). While there's nothing wrong with Little Composter, I did find the implementation very convoluted and poor performance-wise, so I decided to create a far cleaner and easier to use implementation!
